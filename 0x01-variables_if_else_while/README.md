**Functions of all files in order**
* The 0-positive_or_negative.c file is a C program that assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
* The 1-last_digit.c file is a C program that assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. A source code was completed in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. The output of the program is :
- The string 'Last digit of', followed by
- 'n', followed by
- the string 'is', followed by:
- if the last digit of 'n' is greater than 5: the string 'and is greater than 5'
- if the last digit of 'n' is 0: the string 'and is 0'
- if the last digit of 'n' is less than 6 and not 0: the string 'and is less than 6 and not 0'
- followed by a new line
* The 2-print_alphabet.c file is a C program tha prints alphabets in lowercase, followed by a new line using only putchar function.
* The 3-print_alphabets.c file is a C program that prints alphabets in lower case followed by a new line using only putchar function. Used putchar not more than 3 times.
* The 4-print_alphabt.c file is a C program that prints alphabet in lower case, followed by a new line. It prints all letters except q and e. Used putchar functin only and used it not more than twice.
* The 5-print_numbers.c file is a C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
* The 6-print_numberz.c file is a C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. Not allowed to use any variable of type char. You can only use put char function and can only use it not more than twics.
* The 7-print_tebahpla.c file is a C program that prints lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. You can only use putchar function and can only use it twice. All code should be in main function.
* The 8-print_base16.c file is a C program that prints all numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. You can only use putchar functin and can only use it thrice. All code should be in main function.
* The 9-print_comb.c file is a C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. Numbers must be separated by ',' , followed by space. Numbers should be printed in ascending order. You can only use putchar function and can only use it not more than 4 times. Allowed to use any variable of type char.
* The 100-print_comb3.c file is a C program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. Numbers must be separated by ',', followed by space. 
the two digits must be different. 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of two digits 0 and 1. Print only the smallest combination of two digits. Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits. Can only use putchar functions and can only use it not more than 5 times. Not allowed to use any variable of type char. All code should be in the main function.
* The 101-print_comb4.c file is a C program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits. Numbers must be separated by ',', followed by a space. The three digits must be different. 012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the 3 digits 0, 1 and 2. Print only the smallest combination of three digits. Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digigts. You can only use putchar and can only use it six times. Not allowed to use any variable of type char. All code should be in the main funcion.
* The 102-print_comb5.c file is a C program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers. The numbers should range from 0 to 99. The two numbers should be separated by space. All numbers should be printed with two digits, 1 should be printed as 01. The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space. The combination of numbers should be printed in ascending order. Only allowed to use putchar function (every other function printf, puts, etc... is forbidden) and the max is 8 times. Not allowed touse any variable of type char. All code should be in the main function.
