> # C - Preprocessor

## Origin
Completed this project during **Full Stack Software Engineering** from **Holberton School** at **ALX School**

## Objective
Learning about preprocessor, pre-processor directives, creating and using macros, standard predefined macros, and including guard in header files in **C language**

## Tested on
* Ubuntu `20.04 LTS`
* Git Bash `2.32.0`
* Visual Studio Code
* C files was compiled using `gcc 9.3.0`

## Files

| `0-object_like_macro.h` | Header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` |
| `1-pi.h` | Header file that defines a macro named `PI` |
| `2-main.c` | Prints the name of the file it was compiled from |
| `3-function_like_macro.h` | Function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x` |
| `4-sum.h` | Function-like macro `SUM(x,y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y` |
