> # C - malloc, free
## Origin
Completed this project during **Full Stack Software Engineering** from **Holberton School** at **ALX School**

## Objective
Learning about automatic and dynamic memory allocation using malloc and free, and also using valgrind to check for memory leak in **C language**

## Tested on
* Ubuntu `20.04 LTS`
* Git Bash `2.32.0`
* Visual Studio Code
* C files was compiled using `gcc 9.3.0`
